If you ever wanted to add the official mission pack know as Team Arena to the Quake 3 source port that RetroPie offer, then now is your chance to do so. It is based on ioquake3 and the quake3 RetroPie scriptmodule. This port relies on SDL2 libs.

The game is fully playable.
The script provides an automatic installation and uninstallation for compiling and building on Raspberry Pi and RetroPie.

Install time: 10-15 minutes

**Build process:**
1: Download and install necessary required libs for SDL2.
2: Install quake3 first.
3: Add teamarena roms folder
4: Add teamarena as a port of its own.

**In order to play:**
Add the pak files (pak0.pk3, pak1.pk3, pak2.pk3 and pak3.pk3) from your Quake 3 Team Arena installation to /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/ports/teamarena"

**Notes:**
This build works just as great as Quake3.

**Disclaimer:**
This installation script is provided as is. Im not responsible for anything happening with your Raspberry Pi including corruption of SD card, Hardware damage. For support and help you can contact me here on RetroPie forums.
